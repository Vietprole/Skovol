Building an app to sell BlackPink show tickets in the secondary market between individuals, ensuring transparency, and safety, and minimizing the situation where 1 ticket is sold to many people.
# The Problem it solves
The idea of buying and selling tickets in the form of NFT is a type of ticket sale in the OTC market between people who already own tickets from the organizers of Show Blackpink. We call the organizer F0, the person who buys tickets directly from the organizer is F1. 
F1s want to resell tickets to users F2, F3, and vice versa, users F2, and F3 want to buy tickets from F1 again, while there is no trust in each other. 
There is a fact that F1 uses 1 original ticket to sell to many F2 users, to gain illicit profits. The buyer has no way of checking the current ownership status of that ticket or the nearest owner.
 
The problem here:
+ Double spending, 1 original ticket of the organizer can be sold to many people
+ It is not possible to trace the origin of the ticket owned by whom

Stage F0 distributes tickets to F1 is that they already have a way to combat ticket spoofing, but that way is centralized and lacks transparency. They sold a ticket to F1 then it was a real ticket, and the buyer certainly received the ticket. They took full responsibility, and later F1 sold to F2, F3... Fn was the story of those people who trusted each other.
When F1, F2, and F3 transfer tickets to the Blackpink show, they can only trust through their feelings. The actual ownership of the ticket transferor could not be verified.

Solution:
NFT application for the transfer of Born Pink show tickets between users F1, F2, ...Fn
NFTs characteristics:
+ NFT is Non-fungible-Token, meaning that the asset is not divisible, it has integrity 
+ NFT is unique, thanks to the pairs of properties you attach to it, every 1 NFT is minted as unique with its own time-stamp
+ The NFT can verify the origin through the data stored on the blockchain about that NFT.
+ NFTs can be limited in number
+ Transparency: NFt is allowing anyone to view and check the origin and quantity of that NFT.
Based on those characteristics, applying ticket issuance in the form of NFT can solve the problems mentioned at the beginning.
